## Getting Started

To test the application

* Install PostgreSQL database and create a new database for the project:
 ```npx sequelize-cli db:create```
* Update the database credentials in the config/config.js file.
* Run database migrations to create the required tables:
```npx sequelize-cli db:migrate```
* Make a temporary gmail account for testing purposes
* Enable 2 factor authentication and click on app passwords (article: https://mailtrap.io/blog/send-emails-with-nodejs/)
* Add your email and password for the app in the .env file
* Example
EMAIL_SENDER='yourchosenemail@gmail.com'
EMAIL_PASSWORD='password
* Create a random string as JWT secret from
```
https://codebeautify.org/generate-random-string
```
* Copy it and place in in your .env file
* Example
TOKEN_SECRET="yourrandomlygeneratedsecret"
* Start the application
```
nodemon server.js
```
* Register via http://localhost:5000/register with username, email, and password in the body as JSON format via Postman or any alternatives
* If successful, you should get a verification email
* Email link should look like this - http://localhost:5000/verify/token=somerandomlygeneratedjwttoken
* Opening the link will change your username confirmed field to true and show confirmed message in the response
* Login via http://localhost:5000/login with the same email and password
* Your response should have a JSON token
* Open Postman or any API testing tool and set the Authorization header with the value Token <token> (replace <token> with the copied JWT token).
* Make a request to http://localhost:5000/products (get all products)
* If you get 200 OK and {"products": []} as a result, everything was successul
* To manage the cart, cart items, and orders, you can add or remove items from the cart, update cart items and order products
* From there you can edit the app based on your needs
* If you want to seed your products database with some random information, run node products_seed.js in the seeds folder, click "y" to delete all previous products or anything else to just add data without deleting anything
